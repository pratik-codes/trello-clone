# About "K A J K A M"

This project is based on React, Redux and React Beautiful DnD, deployed on Github Pages. There is no backend, the data is stored in the user's browser's local storage. So if the local storage is cleared (for example by clearing cookies), the data will be gone.

To do this project, I took a lot help from the internet. I saw many tutorial videos. One of them was a series on cloning Trello app by a channel called "SelfDevTV". I followed the videos and also the many commits of the git repository.
